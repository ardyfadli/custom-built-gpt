### Hello world! 🌍

Since July 2023, I’ve been experimenting with ChatGPT  
to support ISO management system implementation—  
yeah, I still keep the early outputs,  
and trust me, they were a mess back then, haha.  
The bias, hallucinations,  
and overly confident affirmations made me quit in a month.  

Fast forward to April 2024,  
I gave it another shot for work-related needs,  
and by June I was stunned by how exponentially things had evolved.  
I even discussed directly with ChatGPT itself  
whether AI could fully replace ISO implementation work  
(spoiler: not yet—  
but it can cut down a huge chunk of effort  
if at least one or two operators understand the standard,  
validate the answers,  
and know how to use AI as a tool).  

That’s when I went full-in:  
subscribed, explored GPTs on GPT Explore,  
tested other premium AI tools,  
and yes, I was there when Deepseek first went viral  
*(yep, I definitely registered a Deepseek account)* —  
truly addictive stuff when you realize  
how much time AI can save in real-world ISO work.

After subscribing to ChatGPT,  
the first thing I did was standardize  
my own internal prompt framework  
and embed it into GPT’s memory  
for quick command shortcuts —  
automating how it understands instructions.  

Around November 2024 to April 2025,  
I went on a deep dive  
to test various GPTs built by others  
and picked the ones that worked best  
(honestly I used other AIs too,  
but ChatGPT was definitely  
the most stable one for my workload).  

One month ago,  
I got too attached to one  
that was incredibly productive  
(honestly, like 90% accurate haha),  
until I **ACCIDENTALLY** jailbroke it (😂) —  
yes, I unintentionally exposed  
the internal architecture and Knowledge file.  

That hit me hard and sparked a question:  
what if we had a GPT model that helpful,  
but built with proper data protection?  
And then:  
what if that GPT could integrate directly  
with my workplace’s business processes?

That’s how I ended up becoming  
a GPT Builder just 4 days ago (01 May 2025).  
Through continuous testing  
and trial out of pure curiosity,  
and yes, this morning —  
just a few hours before posting this —  
I finally completed the exact system I envisioned.  

This GPT model was built for internal use,  
but to mark the moment,  
I decided to share how I created it.  

I’m not sure where to upload —  
OpenAI’s Builder Community maybe?  
But for now, I’ll just leave it on GitHub…  
my account’s been gathering dust  
since I made it back in December 2024 🤣  

If you happen to stumble upon this doc  
and you're a GPT Builder yourself,  
I’m wide open to any feedback 😁  

Hope this doc becomes a fun digital time capsule —  
and gives me a good laugh years from now  
when I revisit it ✨
